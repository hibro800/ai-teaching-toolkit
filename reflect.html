      Integrating AI into my teaching has been transformative. Tools like ChatGPT have helped me generate creative lesson plans and personalized content for my students. I can now quickly explain complex topics with AI-generated examples, provide instant feedback, and even create custom quizzes and flashcards. This shift has not only saved me time but also made my lessons more engaging. I feel more confident and inspired to explore new teaching methods that are powered by technology.
